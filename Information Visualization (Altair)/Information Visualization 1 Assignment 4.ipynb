    "We have provided you with some code and parts of the article [The Mayweather-McGregor Fight, As Told Through Emojis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mayweather-mcgregor-fight-as-told-through-emojis/). This article is based on the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [tweets](data/tweets.csv) Created by FiveThirtyEight with the Twitter Streaming API containing a sample of all the tweets that matched the search terms: #MayMac, #MayweatherMcGregor, #MayweatherVMcGregor, #MayweatherVsMcGregor, #McGregor and #Mayweather collected between 12:05 a.m. and 1:15 a.m. EDT, 12,118 that had emojis. Available [on github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mayweather-mcgregor)\n",
    "\n",
    "To earn points for this assignment, you must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recreate the visualizations in the article (replace the images in the article with a code cell that creates a visualization). There are four visualizations to make. For the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, we provide some example code to get the data into the right structure. The points for each visualization are distributed: (30 points: 9 (1st problem) + 7 (each of 2nd, 3rd & 4th)).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _Partial credit can be granted for each visualization (up to 5 points) if you provide the grammar of graphics description of the visualization without a fully implemented Altair solution_\n",
    "\n",
    "- Propose one alternative visualization for one of the 4 article visualizations. Add a short paragraph describing why your visualization is better in terms of Design / Variable types encoding. (20 points/ 15 points plot + 5 justification)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Propose a new visualization to complement a part of the article. Add a short paragraph justifying your decisions in terms of Design / Variable types encoding.  (20 points/ 15 points plot + 5 justification)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you begin\n",
    "*IMPORTANT BROWSER ISSUE*: For some non-ES6 Browsers there are problems with date/time conversions (see [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/times_and_dates.html)). If things aren't working try something like Chrome for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT DATA ISSUE*: There are some differences in the data that 538 used and what we have. This will cause some issues to how things are normalized. Things should look very similar, but you may find, for example, that the scale of tweets when you normalize is different than the original figure. This is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

    "For the nearly 15,000 people in Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, and the millions more huddled around TVs across the world, the Floyd Mayweather–Conor McGregor fight was a roller coaster of emotions. They were anxious as pay-per-view [technical problems](http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20469815/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-delay-ppv-problems) pushed back the fight’s start. They were full of anticipation when the combatants finally emerged after months of hype. They were surprised when McGregor held his own, or seemed to hold his own, for a couple of rounds. They were thrilled when Mayweather finally started fighting. And they were exhausted by the end.\n",

The next couple were washes, and a quarter of the way into the [scheduled 12 rounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/sports/mayweather-mcgregor.html) … the Irish underdog may have been winning!

Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end.
